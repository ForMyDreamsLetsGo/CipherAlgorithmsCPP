# CipherAlgorithmsCPP
A repository of self implemented ,scalable &amp; efficient programs for some Ciphering algorithms in modern C++ using  best to my knowledge programming practices and hopefully easy to understand. written in partial fulfillment of my bachelor's degree in computer science.
They have been These have been verified to work on most inputs but not extensively tested for correctness.

Default way to run after compilation is:
.\executable_file_name<space>Input_file_name //some programs require an extra Key file. proper error prompt is provided for all programs
